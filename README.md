### Current Personal Project Highlights

---

**Closest sausage roll web app:**

This uses my own J**son** dataset of Greggs locations to find the distance to your next sausage roll fix. It uses **AWS lambda** function to return a lnglat and square(1) value which is then used to find the distance to the nearest Greggs location from the dataset stored in **S3** bucket. This is then visualised using the **Mapbox** api (see below)

Further developments include adding a **python** generated **QR code** that will give a google maps route from your current position to the store.

**Pint Price Finder Web App:**

Displays over 50,000 pubs across the uk along with their prices for popular drinks. The goal is to have users submit price updates for their local pubs. (NOTE: currently synthetic data). The system is built with using **javascript** to render the data that is stored in an **S3 bucket** with **aws lambda functions** used to create the dynamic html pages for both pub descriptions and update prices.(See below for some images)

Further developments including intergatrating my **drinks api(3)** to add relevant descriptions to each drink that displayed, further building on my **data driven design**. Additionally i will aim to improve the css and design of the pages. I will also be adding logging as i have sketched below.

**Drinks API:**

When building my pint price finder app (above) i can across a lack of any alcoholic drink apis, so to solve my lack of information i built my own. It contains > 3000 diffrent drinks ranging from wine to beer and spirts. You can use it to get descriptions and alcoholic percentages or use the RANDOM function to get a random drink. It was built using a simple **web scrapper** along with python to create the **python** files along with a simple **AWS lambda** function to act as the API and get the json file from my **S3 bucket**.
